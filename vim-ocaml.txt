OCaml development with Vim
==========================

When I have to write in OCaml, I like better to do it inside a cozy setup.
Here is my current configuration:

Opam
----

Opam seems to be the most convenient way to manage ocaml packages:

``` shell
# aptitude install opam
$ opam init # and answer 'y'
$ eval `opam config env` # or just close and open the terminal again
$ opam update
$ opam upgrade
```

Syntastic
---------

I already had [Syntastic] installed via [Vundle]:

``` .vimrc
Bundle 'Syntastic'
```

Ocp-indent
----------

Probably the best indentation tool around for this language.

Installation with opam:

``` shell
opam install ocp-indent
```

Can be used from the command line:

``` shell
$ ocp-indent in.ml > out.ml	# Out of place
$ ocp-indent -i inout.ml	# In place
```

but also from Vim, with the help of the plugin ocp-indent-vim:

``` .vimrc
Bundle "def-lkb/ocp-indent-vim"
autocmd FileType ocaml exec ":source " . g:opamshare . "/vim/syntax/ocp-indent.vim"
```

Merlin
------

Being an OCaml package, Merlin is better handled by Opam than by Vundle:

``` shell
$ opam install merlin
```

The following lines must then be appended to `.vimrc`:

``` .vimrc
let g:opamshare = substitute(system('opam config var share'),'\n$','','''')
execute "set rtp+=" . g:opamshare . "/merlin/vim"
let g:syntastic_ocaml_checkers = ['merlin']
```

Summary
-------

Now we should have:
  * the indentation on-the-fly;
  * the syntastic syntax warnings;
  * `<leader>t` should display the type of the expression under the cursor;
  * `C-X-O` should pop a completion box for function signatures.

If not, then something is wrong with the setup.

Other plugins (not used)
------------------------

 - oMLet: Indentation tool written in VimL, thus becoming quite slow for
 large files.
 - ocaml-annot
 - vim-slime
